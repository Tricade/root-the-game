# ROOT desktop

The desktop application runs the same simulation and both interfaces as the browser edition. Download packages from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Tricade/root-the-game/releases). No separately installed Node.js or account is required.

| Package                        | Installation                                 | Updates                                         | Progress                                 |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Windows x64 `-setup.exe`       | Per-user NSIS wizard; changeable destination | Built-in check, explicit download and restart   | Electron user-data folder, `network/`    |
| Windows x64 `-portable.exe`    | Run from a writable folder                   | Manual replacement                              | `ROOT-data/network/` beside the EXE      |
| Linux x64 `.deb`               | System package manager                       | Built-in DEB updater; may need OS authorization | Electron user-data folder, `network/`    |
| Linux x64 `-portable.AppImage` | Make executable; run from a writable folder  | Manual replacement                              | `ROOT-data/network/` beside the AppImage |

**Portable editions never instantiate the updater.** Close ROOT, replace the application with a new download and keep `ROOT-data`. The folder must remain writable; keep removable drives connected until ROOT closes. AppImage requires FUSE and permitted Chromium sandbox/user namespaces. Some distributions restrict these for portable apps. The DEB integrates the builder's system sandbox/AppArmor support. Do not work around restrictions with `--no-sandbox`.

## Saves and migration

**Settings → Desktop & updates → Open data folder** locates `network/save.json` and the previous valid `network/save.backup.json`. Installed Windows profiles normally live under `%APPDATA%/ROOT Cyberbunker`; Linux uses `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ROOT Cyberbunker` or `~/.config/ROOT Cyberbunker`. The folder button is authoritative. Desktop preferences and Chromium's UI storage sit alongside `network/`.

Browser installations retain their existing `data/` files and browser storage. Desktop uses its own profile. Transfer progress by exporting a JSON backup in the browser and importing it in desktop Settings. Import exports the previous desktop state first. Keep a backup when trying older versions: file retention does not establish backwards compatibility with older code.

Closing, F5/Ctrl+R and installing an update first pause decisions and drain the revision-safe save queue. Installation is cancelled without confirmed disk persistence. An ordinary close offers a return path to export a backup and an explicit quit-anyway choice. Only one instance uses a desktop profile at a time.

## Installed updates

Installed editions check GitHub's stable feed after startup and on focus, at most once per day automatically. Automatic checks can be disabled. A check does not download an installer. **Download update** validates the download against release SHA-512 metadata; **Install & restart** saves progress before handing control to NSIS/the DEB installer. The OS may refuse or cancel installation; successful downloading does not prove installation succeeded.

The first preview packages are **unsigned**. SHA-512 establishes integrity relative to published metadata, not an independently verified publisher identity. Windows may display an unknown-publisher/SmartScreen prompt. Signed Windows releases need a maintainer-supplied certificate and CI signing secrets. Signature verification has not been disabled. An upgrade between two publicly released desktop versions can only be verified once a second version exists.

Update requests contact GitHub and its asset hosts. Simulation, browser mode and portable mode need no network. Support/release links open in the system browser. There is no telemetry or online AI inference.

## Build and verify

Use Node.js **24.22.1** and the lockfile:

```sh
npm ci --ignore-scripts
node node_modules/electron/install.js
npm run check
npm run desktop
npm run desktop:smoke
npm run desktop:build
```

The explicit install step downloads pinned Electron. Native packages go to ignored `dist/`: Windows builds NSIS + portable EXE; Linux builds DEB + AppImage. Development launches have updates disabled. Smoke tests use fresh synthetic profiles and diagnostic images in ignored `.desktop-build/`, without importing real saves.

`electron-builder.config.cjs` explicitly lists runtime files. `tools/desktop/verify-package.cjs` checks the ASAR's runtime entries, public project identity, excluded saves/build sources and Electron/Chromium notices. This does not establish vulnerability-free dependencies.

Main-process modules separate the local service/protocol, profile, window policy, IPC, save-close coordination and updater. The sandboxed renderer gets a narrow isolated bridge, without Node, generic IPC, arbitrary paths or arbitrary external URLs. A privileged `root://app/` scheme keeps a stable storage origin while the private HTTP service binds an ephemeral loopback port. Browser mode retains its HTTP API and static allowlist.

## Release workflow

Pull requests build and launch native packages in disposable Windows/Linux runners alongside existing checks. The Linux runner relaxes its own user-namespace restriction for portable AppImages; renderer sandboxing stays enabled. This does not prove compatibility with every distribution's default policy.

After a reviewed merge, push a matching `v<package.json version>` tag already contained in `main`. The release workflow checks version/main ancestry, runs checks, builds/tests both platforms and then publishes installers, portable files, updater metadata and `SHA256SUMS.txt`. Uploads are staged in a draft after both builds succeed. A failed draft needs review and is not overwritten automatically. Never publish `builder-debug.yml`, profiles or entire local output directories.
